# EventTaskManager
Event planning can be cumbersome and time-consuming as many elements need to come together at the same time and the same place. Typically when planning an event, the event manager must liaise with several other parties including vendors, site managers, entertainment groups, etc. Our team contacted the Events Office here at WPI to gain some insight into the challenges of planning and managing events on campus. Even though the WPI Events Office uses 25Live, a tracking software package, there are still issues with monitoring/managing tasks that need to be completed before hosting an event. 

In this project, the team will build a database that allows the WPI Events Office to track tasks to be completed as well as the events held on campus. Additionally, the team will build a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for the WPI Events Office and event hosts to manage their events.

To complete this project, the team will contact representatives from the Events Office to gain insights on specific user requirements. Given these requirements, the team will create a UML class diagram (Visual Paradigm, n.d.), to determine a preliminary design of how the data will interact and to form a basis for developing an ERD diagram. Following the creation of the UML diagram, the team will create an ERD (Ramakrishnan & Gehrke, 2003). This diagram will help the team to determine the specific structure of the database and the relations within it. On completing the ERD, the team will then construct the SQL statements needed to create and insert data into the database (Kaufmann & Meier, 2023). To develop a frontend interface, the team will first create interactive prototypes using Figma (Staiano, 2022) to demonstrate the intended app look and functionality to their stakeholders at the Events Office. Then for implementation, they will use React (Krill, 2015) as this framework allows us to develop a modern, user-friendly interface. The team will then utilize Firebase (Singh & Tanna, 2018) for the backend development process as this provides seamless tools and integrations. Lastly, the team created a Gantt chart to ensure that specific milestones are met and that the team does not stray from the timeline of completion.
